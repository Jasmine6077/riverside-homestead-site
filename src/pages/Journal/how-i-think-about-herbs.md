People often ask me how to start with herbs — what to take, what to buy, what works best. And I understand the question quite well. I’ve been there too. Herbs can feel overwhelming fast, especially when they’re presented as cures, shortcuts, or something you have to get “right.”  

But that’s not how I approach them at all.

For me, herbs aren’t about fixing something that’s broken. They’re about support. They’re companions, not commands. I think of them the same way I think of tending a garden or caring for a home — small, consistent acts that add up over time.  

I don’t believe you need a cabinet full of jars or a deep knowledge of Latin plant names to benefit from herbs. I believe you need curiosity, respect, and a willingness to **listen to your body**.

Herbs work best when they’re part of a rhythm, not a reaction.

That might look like:

- Something warming when you feel depleted  
- A cup of tea you drink every night before bed  
- A calming blend during stressful seasons  
- Something grounding when your mind won’t slow down  

I also believe herbs should feel accessible, gentle, and supportive. You shouldn’t need to power through the taste or force yourself to use something that doesn’t feel right to you. Subtle herbs used consistently often do more than strong ones taken occasionally.

Herbs don’t replace rest, nourishment, movement, or medical care. They work **alongside** the basics. They remind us to slow down, check in, and tend to ourselves instead of pushing through.

When I create blends or recommend herbs, I’m always thinking about the season you’re in — physically, emotionally, and literally.  

Winter herbs look different than summer herbs.  
Stress seasons look different than steady ones.  

There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and that’s a good thing.

We all live our lives differently. We process differently. We move through seasons differently. Herbs should reflect these differences, not mask them.

If you’re new to herbs, start simple. Choose just one to really get to know. Learn how it feels in your body. Return to it when your body asks you to. It truly can be that gentle.

Herbalism, at its heart, is a relationship. And like any good relationship, it grows slowly — with attention and care.

That’s how I think about herbs here on the homestead.  
Not as magic fixes,  
but as quiet allies  
in a well-tended life.

**Warmly,**
