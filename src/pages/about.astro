          Riverside Homestead began as a quiet place for slowing down — learning how to live
          with intention, and how to treat healing like something gentle instead of urgent.
        </p>

        <p class="aboutLead">
          What started as a personal journey slowly became something I wanted to share:
          handmade creations, honest reflections, and a life rooted in care.

  <!-- MY JOURNEY -->

      <h2 class="journeyTitle">My Journey</h2>

      <div class="journeyText cozyJourneyText">
        <p>
          My journey has been about learning how to listen to my body, my intuition,
          and the natural rhythms of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through movement, reflection, and time spent reconnecting with myself,
          I’ve learned that healing isn’t something you force — it’s something you allow.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were seasons of pushing forward, and seasons of learning how to soften.
          Both taught me important lessons. Both helped shape who I am today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Riverside Homestead is a reflection of that balance — honoring growth while staying rooted,
          and learning how to live in a way that feels true.
